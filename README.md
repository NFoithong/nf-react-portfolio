# My Portfolio with React.js and Sass

## Description
Create interactive UIs. Design simple views for single-page application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when the data changes.
Declarative views make the code more predictable and easier to debug.

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

Learn how to use Sass to stylesheet. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. 
Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.
